DEAL DATA:
- Lead Name: {lead.name}
- Current Status: {lead.get_status_display()}
- Lead Source: {lead.get_lead_source_display()}
- Quotation Value: {lead.quotation}
- Days in Pipeline: {days_old}
- Followups Done: {followups.filter(status='done').count()}
- Pending Followups: {followups.filter(status='pending').count()}
- Meetings Held: {meetings}
- Quotations Sent: {quotations}
- Payments Made: {payments}
- Communications: {comm_count}
- Notes: {lead.detail or 'None'}

CLOSING PROBABILITY GUIDE:
- 90-100%: Deal is practically closed (payment made, contract signed)
- 70-89%: Very strong signals (multiple meetings, quotation accepted)
- 50-69%: Good progress (active engagement, quotation sent)
- 30-49%: Some interest but needs more work
- 10-29%: Early stage or losing momentum
- 0-9%: Very unlikely to close

Respond in EXACT format:
PROBABILITY: [0-100]
REASON: [one sentence]
RISK: [main risk factor in 5 words or less]
