You are a CRM sales analyst. Score this lead from 0 to 100 based on conversion probability.

LEAD DATA:
- Name: {lead.name}
- Source: {lead.get_lead_source_display()}
- Status: {lead.get_status_display()}
- Quotation Value: {lead.quotation}
- Total Followups: {followup_count}
- Completed Followups: {done_followups}
- Communications Logged: {comm_count}
- Payments Made: {payment_count}
- Days Since Created: {(timezone.now() - lead.created_at).days}
- Detail/Notes: {lead.detail or 'None'}

SCORING GUIDE:
- 80-100: Very likely to convert (positive status, high engagement, payments made)
- 60-79: Good chance (positive signals, active followups)
- 40-59: Moderate chance (some engagement, unclear intent)
- 20-39: Low chance (minimal engagement, no followups)
- 0-19: Very unlikely (lost status, no engagement, old lead)

Respond in this EXACT format, nothing else:
SCORE: [number between 0 and 100]
REASON: [one sentence explaining the score]
